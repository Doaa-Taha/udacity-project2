### the union method
- the time complexity of the to_list() method is O(n) as it iterates over the whole linked list.
- then there's another for loop with time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of both lists together.
- so the worst case time complexity is O(n).

### the intersection method
- the time complexity of the intersection method is the same as the union method.
- for the to_list() method is O(n) and the for loop is O(n) as in worst case senario it will iterate over the whole list.
- so the worst case time complexity is O(n).
